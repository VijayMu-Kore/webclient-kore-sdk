Doing so allows your bots to better understand user utterances, and allows the engine to better prioritize one bot task or intent over another based on the user input.",

"built":"Once you’ve built and trained your bot, you need to carefully test and analyze your ML and NLP models and ensure you have not inadvertently trained your models using a large number of conflicting utterances, while paying close attention to false positives and false negatives.",
"testing_model":"In all, testing helps determine whether or not more training is needed before deploying your bot. After every round of training or retraining, you should review the training model to determine that the changes made were appropriate and to determine whether they’ve enhanced or deteriorated the NLP model.",
